The Documentation folder contains all side documents like:
    -Final presentation
    -Logbook of my work
    -Flowcharts
    -Planning

The KPSVST Folder contains the projects itself, excluding the x64 build folder and the .vs folders.
In the builds/VisualStudio2019 my classes and Visual Studio files can be found.
In the source folder my edits to the JUCE processor and JUCE editor files can be found.
The Editor and Producer are given by JUCE itself.

If you just want to install the current beta (windows only) you can just download the Installer folder, the installer contains
the stand alone plugin, the VST (legacy) and VST3 file.
If you want to use the application on Mac feel free to compile it yourself!
